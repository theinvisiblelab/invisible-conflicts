# invisible-conflicts

This research incvolves building a dataset of 'invisible conflicts' - the idea is to have a stronger focus on global/regional conflicts where the conflicts' presence in media narratives (using data from [newsapi](https://newsapi.org/docs) is much less pronounced than the ground level losses to human life (using data from [ACLED](https://acleddata.com/data/)). The long-term goal is to systematically assess the visibility of each conflict in the news media landscape and suggest ways to improve visibility where possible.
